> ## Self-describing values for Future-proofing

Every choice in computing has a tradeoff. This includes formats, algorithms, encodings, and so on. And even with a great deal of planning, decisions may lead to breaking changes down the road, or to solutions which are no longer optimal. Allowing systems to evolve and grow is important.

## What are Multiformats?

The Multiformats Project is a collection of protocols which aim to future-proof systems, today. They do this mainly by enhancing format values with self-description. This allows interoperability, protocol agility, and helps us avoid lock in.

The self-describing aspects of the protocols have a few stipulations:

- They MUST be _in-band_ (with the value); not _out-of-band_ (in context).
- They MUST avoid _lock-in_ and promote _extensibility_.
- They MUST be compact and have a _binary-packed_ representation.
- They MUST have a _human-readable_ representation.


## Multiformat protocols

Currently, the following multiformat protocols exist:

- [multihash](./multihash) - self-describing <span class="mfc mfc-multihash">hashes</span>
- [multiaddr](./multiaddr)  <small>(WIP)</small> - self-describing <span class="mfc mfc-multiaddr">network addresses</span>
- [multibase](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase)  <small>(WIP)</small> - self-describing <span class="mfc mfc-multibase">base encodings</span>
- [multicodec](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec) - self-describing <span class="mfc mfc-multicodec">serialization</span>
- [multistream](https://github.com/multiformats/multistream) <small>(DEPRECATED)</small> - self-describing <span class="mfc mfc-multistream">stream network protocols</span>
- [multigram](https://github.com/multiformats/multigram) <small>(WIP)</small> - self-describing <span class="mfc mfc-multigram">packet network protocols</span>

<!--
- [multikey](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/issues/58) <small>(WIP)</small> - self-describing <span class="mfc mfc-multikey">keys and proofs</span>
 -->

Each of the projects has its list of implementations in various languages.

### Project Status

Several of the multiformats have stable specs and stable implementations. We're are working on the others. We prioritize their usage as soon as possible, as what they offer -- protocol interoperability and future-proofing -- has real-world consequences today.

Towards that end, we are encouraging improvements to WIP protocols, and implementations of all. Please contribute to the projects on GitHub.


### A note on the word Multiformats

Multiformats is the name for the organization, but it can also be used to refer to protocols; for instance, in the sentence "Use one of the multiformats". Formats is interchangeable with protocols, here. We try to capitalize Multiformats when it refers to the organization, on GitHub.

## Projects using Multiformats

The Multiformats project began through [the IPFS Project](https://ipfs.io). It is used extensively in projects like
